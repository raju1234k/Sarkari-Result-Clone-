            <h3>
           <p> There are a wide variety of government jobs in India. It depends on your interests,
             but a job in the Indian government can range from policy-making, public administration, 
             military, law, engineering, and even teaching. Some of the more highly-paid and in-demand
              positions are discussed below to give you a sense of their requirements and salary expectations.</p>

           <p> 1. Indian Administrative Services (IAS) and Indian Foreign Services (IFS) Jobs : 
            The role of an IAS officer may include advising the ministers on various policy issues,
             implementing policies of the government, collecting revenue, and supervising public spending. 
             An IFS officer manages foreign relations in India with more than 160 Indian Diplomatic Missions
              and International Organizations around the world. The starting monthly salary of an IAS or
               IFS officer is about INR 56,100.</p>
            
            <p>2. Indian Police Services (IPS) Jobs : A role with the IPS involves safeguarding the public, 
                maintaining law and order, and detecting and preventing crime. The role can be with the various
                 agencies and branches including the Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW), Intelligence Bureau (IB),
                  Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), and Criminal Investigation Department (CID). 
                  To be eligible for a job with IPS, there are additional requirements, including physical standards.
                   Physical eligibility includes minimum height for men and women, minimum chest girth for men and women,
                    restriction on vision impairments including myopia limited to less than -4.00,

           <p> 3. Banking Jobs :The banking sector is one of the fastest-growing sectors in India. 
            It's not surprising that jobs in government-approved banks such as the State Bank of India (SBI), 
            Allahabad Bank, HDFC, and ICICI are highly sought after. A job in the banking sector could either 
            be a clerical position such as typists, data entry operators, cashiers, or clerks or a probationary
             officer (PO) role. As a PO, the candidate will be under probation during the training period and 
             will be hired following the probation based on performance. During the training period, 
             the candidate will be trained in accounting, finance, billing, investment, and revenue collection. 
             A PO role allows opportunities for career growth to middle and senior management based on performance
              and additional examinations. The starting monthly salary of a PO is about INR 57,000 including allowances.</p>
            
          <p>  4. Defence Jobs : Jobs with the National Defence Academy (NDA) can be in various departments,
             such as Army, Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard, etc. A job in the NDA comes with strict restrictions on age, 
             physical, and vision standards. Cadet trainees receive a stipend of INR 56,100 per month. Allowances and 
             promotions will increase this salary. There are also several agricultural, engineering,
              and research jobs with their own set of rules and requirements. These can get very complicated,
               but Sarkari Result does all the work for you and lists the various jobs ranging from a
